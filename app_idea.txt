💡 Project Idea
This project is a simple web-based calendar application designed to help IB students plan their study sessions and classes efficiently. Users can input their school classes (e.g., Math HL, Chemistry SL) and create tasks (e.g., "Study for Psychology IA") with due dates. The app then displays this information in a clean, weekly calendar layout. The goal is to improve students' time management by combining class schedules and task planning into one intuitive interface. The interface will be built using basic HTML and CSS for structure and style, with JavaScript or Python (via Flask) used to handle logic and data.
